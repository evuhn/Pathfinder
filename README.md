This pathfinder program allows you to visualize different pathfinding algorithms.
You can choose to do an A* search or Dijkstras algorithm 

## How to Run

obstacles between these two points. Right click to delete any spots.

To run A* search, press the 'a' key to begin. To run Dijkstras, press the 'd' key.

Once the program is done running and a path has been found, you can press 'r' to reset the board an run it again.
